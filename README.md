# Tree-shaking-example

Example implementation of `tree-shaking` and `dead code elimination` of
`Rambda` and `Ramda` with `Webpack` and `Rollup`.

## How to use it?

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/selfrefactor/tree-shaking-example.git&&cd tree-shaking-example`

2. Run `yarn install`

3. Run `yarn start`

## Argumentation

Currently the major advantage of `Rambda` over `Ramda` is its tree-shaking ability and this repo
is the proof the this statement.

It also shows that in terms of tree-shaking, `Rollup` is currently better choice than `Webpack`.
